\section{Biomimetics of poroelastic coatings}

Usually when someone is asked to imagine some "rapid" object as an airplane, a boat or a car, the common sense lead us to think about it as the smoothest as possible and most of the time shiny.
But if we look around us the nature seems not to agree with the previous statement.
In fact most of the surfaces in nature are not smooth at all, they present almost always some kind more or less regular arrangement of discontinuities at various length scales.
Since Nature have had a very large time-span to optimize this kind of surfaces we can be very certain that they are the best possible option.
One should pinpoint that the non smoothness of these surfaces can be connected to some other biological functions rather than pure fluid dynamic performance, and of course it can be the case.


With that in mind we want to show to the reader some of the most notably examples of "natural" aerodynamically surfaces.

Probably the most notable example is the shark skin, in figure \ref{fig:shark} a segment of the skin is depicted as if appears to be under the microscope.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{chapter_1/shark}
	\caption{Microscope enlarged picture of the shark skin.}
	\label{fig:shark}
\end{figure}

The enlargement show that the surface is made up by a series of overlapped denticles, and experiment shows that they can move and interact with the flow.

The shark technology has somehow been applied by Speedo$^{\circledR}$ in their famous swimming suits, that had break multiples world records.
But it seems that this controversial swimmers performance came more on the compressed and streamlined body shape than from the surface texture itself.
In fact during the years this texture material has been publicized to be like synthetic shark skin but \cite{Oeffner785} has shown that the texture is somehow different from the shark dermal structure.
They have also performed some swimming experiment with a flat plate with different surfaces and they have found no significant speed enhancement with the swimsuit surfaces; but the measurements with the shark skin on the contrary give an appreciable improvement in the performance.


Poroelastic surfaces find also applications in aeroacoustics, in fact the owl is well known for its particularly silent flight, in the high frequency spectrum.
This characteristic is crucial for the owl in order to be able to capture his preys.
Obviously it has inspired the scientific community to study the feathers configuration and their shape.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{chapter_1/howl}
	\caption{Feathers in owl's wing: trailing edge (left), leading edge (right). The difference in shape, and mechanical properties as rigidity, between the leading and trailing edge is a consequence of the different flow regimes in the wing.}
	\label{fig:owl}
\end{figure}
 
Multiple authors show promising result in characterizing the acoustic properties of the owl skin and their physical mechanism.
In particular \cite{lilley1998} present three main characteristic of the owl that can suppress its airborne noise: the feathers leading edge shaped like a comb, the feathers trailing edge that form a fringe and the presence of multiple "filaments" in the bottom surface of the wing and on its legs.
in the same work he also present some experimental and empirical evidence on the aeroacoustics mechanism behind the three elements above.

Another examples of work in the field of owls acoustic is the one by \cite{jaworski2013aerodynamic} in which the authors study the acoustic scattering problem of a poroelastic half-plane hit by an incident plane wave.
This configuration has been used as an analogy with the owl wing, it try to explain how the properties of this surface can suppress the noise.
They conclude that the combined effects of elasticity and porosity can produce the weakest edge noise amplification.

Recent computational simulation made by \cite{rao2017owl} confirm that the leading edge shape of the feathers truly suppress noise and enhance the lift generation for angles of attack grater then $15^{\circ}$.


Bioinspired aerodynamic surfaces include another peculiar example in the butterflies wings.
In figure \ref{fig:butterfly} the surface of a "Peacock butterfly" is enlarged in order to show the multiple scales involved; the wing structure present firstly as overlapped scales similar to the shark, but looking closely we can observe that the singles scales have a complicated permeable structure.

	\label{fig:butterfly}
\end{figure}

The work of \citet{slegers2017beneficial} the authors study the effect of such porous structure in the flight performance of butterflies.
Using cameras to measure the kinematics of their flight, they can compute their efficiency to "climb" (generate lift) and the stroke amplitude and frequency.
The authors conclude, after the proper statistical tests on the overall butterfly population, that the porous structure of their wing gives a boost in climbing efficiency about $30\%$; that results clearly stress out the importance of the poroelastic layer of the wings. 
Even though the flight aerodynamic is extremely complex \cite{srygley2002unconventional}, it seems clear that the peculiar structure of the wings surface is critical for their aerodynamic performances.


Superhydrophobic surfaces works as they were water repellent, in fact over such surfaces the water can slide over with much less resistance resulting in very small values of wettability.
This behavior is caused by the microscopic structure that forms the surface \ref{fig:lotus}, in fact the rugosities are arranged in a more or less regular way in order to be able to capture air pockets that rest inside this structures.
These air inclusion provoke an effective slip at the air-liquid interface that cause the drag reduction; but they also change the contact angle of droplets 
The work of \citet{bottaro2003effect} summarize the above aspect and their applications.

The interest reader could find other examples and broaden the above key aspect also in \cite{bhushan2016biomimetics}, \cite{tropea2012nature}.



\subsection{Riblets and shark-skin surfaces}

We have seen that natural surface can be an inspiration to find strategies to solve many aerodynamics problems; in the following we will focus especially on the drag reduction.

Is known that the total drag contribution can be separated in different components, and the classical decomposition is between skin-friction and pressure drag.

\begin{equation}
 \int_{A_{\sigma}}  [ \underbrace{\left( \frac{p}{\rho} \mathbf{I} \right) \cdot  \mathbf{n}_{\sigma} }_\text{pressure drag}  +  \underbrace{ \left( \nu \nabla \mathbf{v} \right) \cdot  \mathbf{n}_{\sigma}}_\text{viscous drag} ] \; dA,
 \label{eq:force}
\end{equation}



Where $A_{\sigma}$ is the solid interface of some object where a no slip condition is applied, and $ \mathbf{n}_{\sigma}$ is its outward normal.

Since most of the industrial application involves turbulent flow, obviously there is a lot of research that aim to reduce the skin-friction in this regime.
Table 6.3.1 in the book of \citet{mclean2012understanding} make a wide list of technique already been proposed on the problem.

As the same author pinpoint the most effective, and probably the most practicable concept, are the riblets.
They are regularly arranged alternating ridges aligned in the streamwise flow direction as the figure \ref{fig:riblets1} show.

These surfaces are capable of align the turbulent flow in the mean flow direction smoothing the fluctuation of the cross-flow in the viscous sublayer.
Reducing this fluctuations close to the surface the turbulent momentum transfer will also be reduced and so the shear stress, causing the reduction in skin-friction.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{chapter_1/riblets3}
	\caption{Schematics of the physics ... \citet{bechert1997experiments}}
	\label{fig:riblets1}
\end{figure}


The viscous drag reduction correlates well with the spacing between the ridges expressed in wall units $ s^+ $, the typical shape is depicted in \ref{fig:riblets_perf} where the vertical axis show the drag reduction computed against the smooth surface case against the $ s^+ $.
This general shape of the curve, in which the skin friction decrease in certain range of spacing and then increase as the $ s^+ $ increase, is caused by a competition between the capacity of riblets to obstruct lateral fluid flow and an increase in the penetration of high speed vorticies inside this manufactured rugosities.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{chapter_1/riblets_performance}
	\caption{Performance ... \citet{jimenez2001turbulent} }
	\label{fig:riblets_perf}
\end{figure}

This last physical explanation of the riblets performances is presented in the schematics \ref{fig:riblets_schem}, where the grey areas show high skin-friction regions caused by the downwash motion generated by the near-wall vortices.
Is it clear that when the riblets are too big the vortices can penetrate inside its groove and actually increase the skin-friction due to larger area exposed to the local velocity.
On the contrary when the riblets are smaller, the high speed vortices "touch" only the tip of the ridges so only a small local area of the surface experience high-shear stresses.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{chapter_1/riblets1}
	\caption{ ... \citet{choi1993direct} }
	\label{fig:riblets_schem}
\end{figure}

The slope of the curve \ref{fig:riblets_perf} can be predicted by linear stability theory or by means of empirical correlations as in \citet{garcia2011hydrodynamic}.

Computing the performance of such surfaces can be expensive since the most reliable quantitative theory for such problems are DNS simulations or experiments.
There is only one other theory, besides the already cited expensive ones, that use the concept of of \textit{protusion height} showed in \ref{fig:riblets1} to correlates the shape of the protusion to the drag reduction \citet{luchini1991resistance}.
The \textit{protusion height} is defined as the vertical distance between the riblet top ridge and point of zero velocity extrapolated from the constant velocity gradient outside above the protusions.
It seems that especially the difference of protusion heights computed from the streamwise $h_{ps}$ and cross-flow flow $h_{pc}$ correlates very well with the drag reduction, and the two quantities can be computed with a simple Stokes problem over the local geometry of the grooves.

Another very impressive characteristic is that the performance are robust in off-design, such as the yaw (misalignment between the flow and the riblets ridges) and tip erosion of the ridges \citet{garcia2011drag}.

But still besides some very specific application, such as  sailing competitions in which the hulls of the USA challengers in the America’s Cup 1987 and 2010 were fitted with riblets, the massive utilization of this technology is still in question.
Since the riblets size need to be very little, producing such surfaces in a larger area like the roof of a car or the wing of an airplane can be an issue for a routine use.

Riblets like surface has been observed in nature for many years, for example \citet{Martin2016riblets} found out that skimmer birds (Rynchops) have riblets like grooves in their beak, since they fly with it under the surface of the water to catch fishes.
But, as already introduced, the most clear example of such natural surfaces are shark skin.
In his review \citet{dean2010shark} present the status of the shape optimization that has been done on the riblets trying to mimic the typical sawthoot shape seen in shark skin, showing that improvements of such geometries over the classical ones has yet to be proven.
Shape optimization on riblets geometry has been studied also by \citet{bechert1997experiments} finding that the drag reduction can be improved very little just working on the geometry even though a few $\%$ can be gained.

There is in fact some controversial result in literature that state that surfaces with actual shark skin replica can indeed increase drag.
\citet{boomsma2016direct} for example perform some simulations on actual shark skin denticles using the immersed boundary method; he find that in some configuration 
the actual drag increase up to $40\%$, but even though the numbers are probably too large (it is know that the immersed boundary method can generate large errors in force computation especially in high Reynolds number flows), this can prove that the shark skin does not work with the same mechanism as riblets.

In fact \citet{bechert1997natural} had already tested such geometries in his experiments. 
He builds a synthetic surface made by artificial shark denticles posed on top of spings and he measure that even with the introduction of the surface elasticity the actual drag was increasing.
however the authors pinpoints that the actual shark flow regime is nothing at all as steady as the experiments that he performed, and he speculates that the excellent swimming performance of the shark came from the separation control that flexible denticles can increase in the periodic oscillating flow that the swimming generate.

Experiment using DPIV on a NACA covered with actual skin samples of "Isurus oxyrinchus" mako shark, has been performed by \citet{lang2014SharkControl}, confirming that the flexibility of sharks denticles perform as a passive flow control in order to avoid early separation.
In fact the experiments proves that for angles of attack larger than $15^{\circ}$ the flow reversal is almost completely avoided.
The same author introduce the importance in the different geometries of the denticles in different part of the body that obviously experience different flow condition,
\citet{motta2012Shark} perform a detailed collection of flexibility and scale measurement of different shark species that can be valuable for future studies.

Swimming experiment from \cite{Oeffner785}, who used a flat plate covered with real shark skin, also confirm the previous flow control mechanism and also make some conjectures about possible thrust enhancing controlled by the same movable scale that can move away the leading edge vortex.

Also \citet{itoh2006turbulent} shows that movable rugosities can outperform riblets, the authors in fact measure the drag reduction of a seal fur (that present fibrous movable surface) against a riblet surface in an experimental channel; its results are show in figure \ref{fig:seal}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{chapter_1/seal}
\caption{Image from \citet{itoh2006turbulent}.}
\label{fig:seal}
\end{figure}


Compliant surfaces can in fact move accordingly to the surface pressure gradients along the boundary layer and so respond to the pressure fluctuation over the surface itself.
This mechanism is already know to be beneficial to delay the transition to turbulence and many authors have presented theoretical and experimental evidence on the effectiveness of this solution \cite{carpenter1990status}, \cite{bushnell1977effect}.

So we have seen that to reduce turbulent skin-friction drag riblets and natural surfaces uses various mechanism such as: sublayer vortices interaction, compliance and separation control.
Such solution have proven to be effective in some cases but they are related mostly in reducing the viscous component of the total drag.
In the next section we will introduce another class of solution that try to act instead on the pressure component.


\subsection{Permeable surfaces}

More vertical extended porous surfaces instead try to act on the pressure drag contribution, that depends on the overall pressure distribution on the body.
Usually the pressure contribution is the most significant and even in highly streamlined body its around the $10\%$ of the total drag.
